// Package plot provides an API for setting up plots, and primitives for
// drawing on plots.
//
// Plot is the basic type for creating a plot, setting the title, axis
// labels, legend, tick marks, etc.  Types implementing the Plotter
// interface can draw to the data area of a plot using the primitives
// made available by this package.  Some standard implementations
// of the Plotter interface can be found in the
// gonum.org/v1/plot/plotter package
// which is documented here:
// https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/plot/plotter
package plot // import "gonum.org/v1/plot"
