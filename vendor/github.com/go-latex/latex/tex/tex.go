// Package tex provides a TeX-like box model.

// The following is based directly on the document 'woven' from the
// TeX82 source code.  This information is also available in printed
// form:

//    Knuth, Donald E.. 1986.  Computers and Typesetting, Volume B:
//    TeX: The Program.  Addison-Wesley Professional.

// The most relevant "chapters" are:
//    Data structures for boxes and their friends
//    Shipping pages out (Ship class)
//    Packaging (hpack and vpack)
//    Data structures for math mode
//    Subroutines for math mode
//    Typesetting math formulas
//
// Many of the docstrings below refer to a numbered "node" in that
// book, e.g., node123
//
// Note that (as TeX) y increases downward.
