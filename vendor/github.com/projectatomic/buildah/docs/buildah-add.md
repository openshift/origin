# buildah-add "1" "March 2017" "buildah"

## NAME
buildah\-add - Add the contents of a file, URL, or a directory to a container.

## SYNOPSIS
**buildah add** [*options*] *container* *src* [[*src* ...] *dest*]

## DESCRIPTION
Adds the contents of a file, URL, or a directory to a container's working
directory or a specified location in the container.  If a local source file
appears to be an archive, its contents are extracted and added instead of the
archive file itself.  If a local directory is specified as a source, its
*contents* are copied to the destination.

## OPTIONS

**--chown** *owner*:*group*

Sets the user and group ownership of the destination content.

**--quiet**

Refrain from printing a digest of the added content.

## EXAMPLE

buildah add containerID '/myapp/app.conf' '/myapp/app.conf'
