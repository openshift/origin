                digests in pods to be pulled from alternative mirrored repository
                locations. The image pull specification provided to the pod will be
                compared to the source locations described in RepositoryDigestMirrors
                and the image may be pulled down from any of the mirrors in the list
                instead of the specified repository allowing administrators to choose
                a potentially faster mirror. Only image pull specifications that have
                an image disgest will have this behavior applied to them - tags will
                continue to be pulled from the specified repository in the pull spec.
                \n Each “source” repository is treated independently; configurations
                for different “source” repositories don’t interact. \n When multiple
                policies are defined for the same “source” repository, the sets of
                defined mirrors will be merged together, preserving the relative order
                of the mirrors, if possible. For example, if policy A has mirrors
                `a, b, c` and policy B has mirrors `c, d, e`, the mirrors will be
                used in the order `a, b, c, d, e`.  If the orders of mirror entries
                conflict (e.g. `a, b` vs. `b, a`) the configuration is not rejected
                but the resulting order is unspecified."
