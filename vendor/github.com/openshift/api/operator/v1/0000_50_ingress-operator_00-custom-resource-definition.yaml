                    \n If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to
                    point at the LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records
                    are managed only in DNS zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster
                    .spec.publicZone and .spec.privateZone. \n Wildcard DNS management
                    is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms.
                    \n * HostNetwork \n Publishes the ingress controller on node ports
                    where the ingress controller is deployed. \n In this configuration,
                    the ingress controller deployment uses host networking, bound
                    to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for configuring
                    an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via
                    the node ports. \n * Private \n Does not publish the ingress controller.
                    \n In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses
                    container networking, and is not explicitly published. The user
                    must manually publish the ingress controller. \n * NodePortService
                    \n Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort
                    Service. \n In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment
                    uses container networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish
                    the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated
                    by OpenShift; however, to support static port allocations, user
                    changes to the node port field of the managed NodePort Service
                    will preserved."
