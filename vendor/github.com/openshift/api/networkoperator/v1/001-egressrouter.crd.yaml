        description: "EgressRouter is a feature allowing the user to define an egress
          router that acts as a bridge between pods and external systems. The egress
          router runs a service that redirects egress traffic originating from a pod
          or a group of pods to a remote external system or multiple destinations
          as per configuration. \n It is consumed by the cluster-network-operator.
          More specifically, given an EgressRouter CR with <name>, the CNO will create
          and manage: - A service called <name> - An egress pod called <name> - A
          NAD called <name> \n EgressRouter is a single egressrouter pod configuration
          object."
