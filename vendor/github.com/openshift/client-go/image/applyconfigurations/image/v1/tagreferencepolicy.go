	// that the pull spec should point to the integrated container image registry and leverage the registry's
	// ability to proxy the pull to an upstream registry. `Local` allows the credentials used to pull this
	// image to be managed from the image stream's namespace, so others on the platform can access a remote
	// image but have no access to the remote secret. It also allows the image layers to be mirrored into
	// the local registry which the images can still be pulled even if the upstream registry is unavailable.
