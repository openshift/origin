.SH NAME
.PP
openshift infra router \- Start a router


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBopenshift infra router\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Start a router

.PP
This command launches a router connected to your cluster master. The router listens for routes and endpoints
created by users and keeps a local router configuration up to date with those changes.

.PP
You may customize the router by providing your own \-\-template and \-\-reload scripts.

.PP
You may restrict the set of routes exposed to a single project (with \-\-namespace), projects your client has
access to with a set of labels (\-\-project\-labels), namespaces matching a label (\-\-namespace\-labels), or all
namespaces (no argument). You can limit the routes to those matching a \-\-labels or \-\-fields selector. Note
that you must have a cluster\-wide administrative role to view all namespaces.
