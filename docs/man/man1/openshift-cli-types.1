.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Concepts and Types

.PP
Kubernetes and OpenShift help developers and operators build, test, and deploy applications in a containerized cloud environment. Applications may be composed of all of the components below, although most developers will be concerned with Services, Deployments, and Builds for delivering changes.

.PP
Concepts:
.IP 

.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Containers:
A definition of how to run one or more processes inside of a portable Linux
environment. Containers are started from an Image and are usually isolated
from other containers on the same machine.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Image:
A layered Linux filesystem that contains application code, dependencies,
and any supporting operating system libraries. An image is identified by
a name that can be local to the current cluster or point to a remote Docker
registry (a storage server for images).
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Pods [pod]:
A set of one or more containers that are deployed onto a Node together and
share a unique IP and Volumes (persistent storage). Pods also define the
security and runtime policy for each container.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Labels:
Labels are key value pairs that can be assigned to any resource in the
system for grouping and selection. Many resources use labels to identify
sets of other resources.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Volumes:
Containers are not persistent by default \- on restart their contents are
cleared. Volumes are mounted filesystems available to Pods and their
containers which may be backed by a number of host\-local or network
attached storage endpoints. The simplest volume type is EmptyDir, which
is a temporary directory on a single machine. Administrators may also
allow you to request a Persistent Volume that is automatically attached
to your pods.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Nodes [node]:
Machines set up in the cluster to run containers. Usually managed
by administrators and not by end users.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Services [svc]:
A name representing a set of pods (or external servers) that are
accessed by other pods. The service gets an IP and a DNS name, and can be
exposed externally to the cluster via a port or a Route. It's also easy
to consume services from pods because an environment variable with the
name <SERVICE>\_HOST is automatically injected into other pods.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Routes [route]:
A route is an external DNS entry (either a top level domain or a
dynamically allocated name) that is created to point to a service so that
it can be accessed outside the cluster. The administrator may configure
one or more Routers to handle those routes, typically through an Apache
or HAProxy load balancer / proxy.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Replication Controllers [rc]:
A replication controller maintains a specific number of pods based on a
template that match a set of labels. If pods are deleted (because the
node they run on is taken out of service) the controller creates a new
copy of that pod. A replication controller is most commonly used to
represent a single deployment of part of an application based on a
built image.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Deployment Configuration [dc]:
Defines the template for a pod and manages deploying new images or
configuration changes whenever those change. A single deployment
configuration is usually analogous to a single micro\-service. Can support
many different deployment patterns, including full restart, customizable
rolling updates, and fully custom behaviors, as well as pre\- and post\-
hooks. Each deployment is represented as a replication controller.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Build Configuration [bc]:
Contains a description of how to build source code and a base image into a
new image \- the primary method for delivering changes to your application.
Builds can be source based and use builder images for common languages like
Java, PHP, Ruby, or Python, or be Docker based and create builds from a
Dockerfile. Each build configuration has web\-hooks and can be triggered
automatically by changes to their base images.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Builds [build]:
Builds create a new image from source code, other images, Dockerfiles, or
binary input. A build is run inside of a container and has the same
restrictions normal pods have. A build usually results in an image pushed
to a Docker registry, but you can also choose to run a post\-build test that
does not push an image.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Image Streams and Image Stream Tags [is,istag]:
An image stream groups sets of related images under tags \- analogous to a
branch in a source code repository. Each image stream may have one or
more tags (the default tag is called "latest") and those tags may point
at external Docker registries, at other tags in the same stream, or be
controlled to directly point at known images. In addition, images can be
pushed to an image stream tag directly via the integrated Docker
registry.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Secrets [secret]:
The secret resource can hold text or binary secrets for delivery into
your pods. By default, every container is given a single secret which
contains a token for accessing the API (with limited privileges) at
/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount. You can create new
secrets and mount them in your own pods, as well as reference secrets
from builds (for connecting to remote servers) or use them to import
remote images into an image stream.
.IP
\(bu 
.PP
Projects [project]:
All of the above resources (except Nodes) exist inside of a project.
Projects have a list of members and their roles, like viewer, editor,
or admin, as well as a set of security controls on the running pods, and
limits on how many resources the project can use. The names of each
resource are unique within a project. Developers may request projects
be created, but administrators control the resources allocated to
projects.
