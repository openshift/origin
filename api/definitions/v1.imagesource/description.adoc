ImageSource is used to describe build source that will be extracted from an image. A reference of
type ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage or DockerImage may be used. A pull secret can be specified
to pull the image from an external registry or override the default service account secret if pulling
from the internal registry. A list of paths to copy from the image and their respective destination
within the build directory must be specified in the paths array.
