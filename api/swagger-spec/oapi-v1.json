If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 ResourceExpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. This field is not supported when watch is true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications.",

The hook executes a command in a temporary container running the build output image, immediately after the last layer of the image is committed and before the image is pushed to a registry. The command is executed with the current working directory ($PWD) set to the image's WORKDIR.\n\nThe build will be marked as failed if the hook execution fails. It will fail if the script or command return a non-zero exit code, or if there is any other error related to starting the temporary container.\n\nThere are five different ways to configure the hook. As an example, all forms below are equivalent and will execute `rake test --verbose`.\n\n1. Shell script:\n\n       \"postCommit\": {\n         \"script\": \"rake test --verbose\",\n       }\n\n    The above is a convenient form which is equivalent to:\n\n       \"postCommit\": {\n         \"command\": [\"/bin/sh\", \"-ic\"],\n         \"args\":    [\"rake test --verbose\"]\n       }\n\n2. A command as the image entrypoint:\n\n       \"postCommit\": {\n         \"commit\": [\"rake\", \"test\", \"--verbose\"]\n       }\n\n    Command overrides the image entrypoint in the exec form, as documented in\n    Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint.\n\n3. Pass arguments to the default entrypoint:\n\n       \"postCommit\": {\n\t\t      \"args\": [\"rake\", \"test\", \"--verbose\"]\n\t      }\n\n    This form is only useful if the image entrypoint can handle arguments.\n\n4. Shell script with arguments:\n\n       \"postCommit\": {\n         \"script\": \"rake test $1\",\n         \"args\":   [\"--verbose\"]\n       }\n\n    This form is useful if you need to pass arguments that would otherwise be\n    hard to quote properly in the shell script. In the script, $0 will be\n    \"/bin/sh\" and $1, $2, etc, are the positional arguments from Args.\n\n5. Command with arguments:\n\n       \"postCommit\": {\n         \"command\": [\"rake\", \"test\"],\n         \"args\":    [\"--verbose\"]\n       }\n\n    This form is equivalent to appending the arguments to the Command slice.\n\nIt is invalid to provide both Script and Command simultaneously.

The default value is `Source`, indicating the original location of the image should be used (if imported). The user may also specify `Local`, indicating that the pull spec should point to the integrated Docker registry and leverage the registry's ability to proxy the pull to an upstream registry. `Local` allows the credentials used to pull this image to be managed from the image stream's namespace, so others on the platform can access a remote image but have no access to the remote secret. It also allows the image layers to be mirrored into the local registry which the images can still be pulled even if the upstream registry is unavailable."
